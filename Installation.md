- Put _Reddit-Wallpaper.jar_ in C:/Program Files/Reddit Wallpaper
- Put _autostartRW.bat_ in the autostart folder of Windows: this can be found by typing `shell:startup` in Run (`Win+R`). Alternatively you can create such directory `C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
