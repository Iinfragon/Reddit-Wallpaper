Tool to download and automatically set a random wallpaper from reddit

Work in progress! But it does work and is stable!

State: It's able to:
- query reddit's API with the specified parameters
- extrapolate datas from such queries
- select the wallpaper to download through a non-repetitive pattern
- apply (only xfce and only on my machine probably)
- GUI to control settings
- System Tray
- Running in background and changing wallpaper each X mins
- Supports galleries!
- Support Windows
- Dark Theme

Known Issues:
- Doesn't support crossposts: they cause an error which blocks the setting of the wallpaper
- Clicking furiosly while the program is elaborating something else may cause an error
- Log panel gets loooong
- Autostart is not supported (Yet!)
- Sometimes the tray icon on Windows become more than one, with a weird effect
- pinterest galleries aren't supported (yet)

ToDo:
- Add option to download only horizontal wallpapers
- Add option to download only wallpapers with a ratioi similar to the screen user
