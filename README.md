It allows you to decide the period of time after you get bored by a wallpaper and changes it, and you won't need to move a single muscle

#### Disclaimer
I need help! I'm kinda a beginner in Java development and in general as a software beginner. For sure this project is full of hidden bugs, bad practices, unoptimal implementations and so on. Furthermore, the program has me as the only tester.
I need help, I need feedbacks, I need people to tell me that they like this/dislike that. Only with such support this tool will get better

**Known Bugs:**
- Doesn't support crossposts: they cause an error which blocks the setting of the wallpaper
- Clicking furiosly while the program is elaborating something else may cause an error
- Log panel gets loooong
- Sometimes the tray icon on Windows become more than one, with a weird effect (to be confirmed)
- pinterest galleries aren't supported (yet)

**ToDo:**
- [ ] Add option to download only horizontal wallpapers
- [ ] Add option to download only wallpapers with a ratio similar to the screen user
